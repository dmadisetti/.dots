# dots manager

pretty much managed through flake scripts and fish functions. Refer to 
[scripts help](../scripts/messages/help.md), (or just run `dots-help`).

so the dream is just to read + manage from nix modules, but not at a scale
where that really makes sense, so one off definitions seem fine for me
right now
