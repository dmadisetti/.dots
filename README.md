## (.dots) [![this is currently](https://github.com/dmadisetti/.dots/actions/workflows/flake.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dmadisetti/.dots/actions/workflows/flake.yaml)

**so** you want to steal _my_ `.dots`? that's cool, and in fact encourged. feel free to use this as template, i just ask you leave a star.
  
### installation

if you just want my `.dots` run `setup.sh`. if you want the whole os experience, start with the live disk or 

```bash
nix flake run github:dmadisetti/.dots#live;
# or nix flake run github:dmadisetti/.dots#install if you don't want the live disk, but you're missing out.
```

and that's it. follow the wizard üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

### contribution

lol, i don't want your contributions. i'm only slightly joking. it's okay to have optionated, individualized, hacky dots- and suggesting changes to my `.vimrc` is a personal attack.

however, if you provide changes that make the templating system and bootstrapping system better (or you just want to show me something cool), then i'd love your contributions. make sure that you are creating a pull request against [main](https://github.com/dmadisetti/.dots/tree/main). just note, that because these are _my_ `.dots`- i might not take _your_ suggestions. that's why i reccomend templating over forking `:)`
